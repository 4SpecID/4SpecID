Three files exist here:
1. DistMat.tsv: tab-separated file containing distance between clusters
2. dummyDataset.tsv: tab-separated file with mandatory data. The file can have as many field as the user wants. This one contains 6 fields, two are just random numbers without meaning and another has some random numbers, some non-sense text and some blanks. Mandatory fields must be named: "institution_storing"; "bin_uri"; and "species_name"
3. dummyDataset_v2.tsv: same as dummyDataset.tsv but with different species/clusters/sources trios
