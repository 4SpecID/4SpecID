Three files exist here:
1. Bovidae.tsv: raw data, directly downloaded from BOLD.
2. Bovidae_BIN.tsv: replaces the source of the records mined from GenBank by the authors has they appear following the GenBank accession number.
3. Bovidae_COI.tsv: Subset of the previous by removing non-COI sequences. This was the one use in the 4SpecID publication
